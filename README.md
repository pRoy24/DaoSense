# DAO Sense

A set of infrastructure tooling contracts along with a client application that shows how Chainlink VRF and Chainlink automation can be leveraged to automate DAO operations based on time and on-chain triggers.

  

This project is built in fulfillment of the [Chainlink Fall 2022 hackathon](https://chain.link/hackathon)

**Projects**

Contracts

This project contains the main contract which is an ERC721 compatible contract along with extensions to allow for randomizing mints, transparently and dynamically updating mint auction and allowlist as well as token emissions.

  

Client

This is a ReactJS app created using CRA and Tailwind css. The front-end has been tested on Metamask provider on Chrome and is hosted on IPFS over Pinata.
